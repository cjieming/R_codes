data <- read.table(pcaFilename, header=TRUE, sep="\t", stringsAsFactors = F)

that is cos R reads the sample.id as factors 
 when you read.table
 add in stringsAsFactors=F
 this will retain all the sample.id as strings
 try again?

id3 - which(something)
 dat.new - dat[id3,]
 this means to get the rows of dat, as indexed by id3

 ok
 say i want a particular column with a name
 or i must know the col no
xueling says
 dat.new - dat[id3,1] if you know the column number
 dat.new - dat[id3,sample.id] if you know the column name
